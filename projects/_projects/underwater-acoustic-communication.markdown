Frequency-shift keying (FSK) is implemented on a 32bit AVR microcontroller.
Due to the low processing power of the microcontroller, various methods are introduced to optimise calculations or to postpone it when the microcontroller is less busy.

Moreover, the implementation is integrated into an existing codebase.
Various measurements are performed in order to evaluate the performance of the implementation such as minimal distance between frequencies, error rate, the influence of different environments and the maximal number of bits per symbol.
The results show that the required performances are achieved.
