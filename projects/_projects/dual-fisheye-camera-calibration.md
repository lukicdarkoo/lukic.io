Within the project we develop a calibration algorithm for a dual fisheye camera with lenses oriented in the opposite direction

<!--more-->

The project is done as a semester project at TOPO laboratory. The purpose of the project was to develop a calibration algorithm for a dual fisheye camera with lenses oriented in the opposite direction. The intrinsic parameters are of both cameras, as well as a rotation between the cameras, are determined using nonlinear least-squares optimisation. Multiple approaches are evaluated to maximise accuracy and minimise correlation between determined parameters. In addition, a simple semiautomatic chessboard corner finding tool is developed to obtain data set from highly distorted images.
