It has implemented disease and bad weather prediction based on data found on the Internet.

Custom Arduino shield is developed to drive actuators and sensors in greenhouse model.
Desktop, C# application presents the bridge between the web application and Arduino.
The web application uses Yii on back-end and Bootstrap on front-end to provide a smart control logic and the graphic user interface for a variety of screen sizes and platforms.
