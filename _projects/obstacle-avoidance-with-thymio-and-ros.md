We modeled a Thymio robot in URDF, implemented velocity control and obtacle avoidance in scope of ROS.

This is a small project done in scope of <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/robotics-practicals-MICRO-453">Robotics practicals</a> course.
It was the first time I used the ROS to control a robot in Gazebo simulation.
The project included robot URDF modeling, PID regulation for velocity control and implementation of an arbitrary algorithm for obstacle avoidance.
