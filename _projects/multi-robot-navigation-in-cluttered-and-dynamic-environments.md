We implemented potential field algorithm for obstacle avoidance, flocking, and optimized the robot's behaviour with PSO.

The control of multi-robot navigation can be a challenge in real world.
We implemented and optimized our strategy in two cluttered and dynamic environment.
Finally, the algorithm is transferred into real e-puck robots and its performance justify the effectiveness of our design choice.
