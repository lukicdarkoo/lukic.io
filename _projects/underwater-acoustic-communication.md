We implemented frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation on a microcontroller to allow underwater communication for underwater unmanned vehicles.

Due to the low processing power of the microcontroller, various methods are introduced to optimise calculations or to postpone it when the microcontroller is less busy.
Moreover, the implementation is integrated into an existing codebase.
Various measurements are performed in order to evaluate the performance of the implementation such as minimal distance between frequencies, error rate, the influence of different environments and the maximal number of bits per symbol.
The underwater communication is verified in laboratory conditions.

The project is done as a semester project at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/disal/">DISAL</a>.
