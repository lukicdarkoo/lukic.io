We created a robotic prototyping platform to allow users to create, share and distribute interactive applications. 

<!--more-->

The idea behind the project is to provide a simple JavaScript API for programmers to develop and run applications for robot inside a web browser.
Using a browser and web technologies makes application distribution easy, switching between applications fast, each application is platform and screen size-independent and web technologies have a huge community.


Library for the platform is developed using ECMAScript 6 which provides simple API for developing <a href="https://spesrobo.bitbucket.io/store/">SpesRobo applications</a>.
Library communicates with the robot using extended WebSocket protocol.
For the purpose of a presentation, there are a few applications mostly build with React.js and Flux.
